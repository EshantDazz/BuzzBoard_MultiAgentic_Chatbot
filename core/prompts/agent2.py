Core Functionality/Purpose
 The Prospect Insights Agent, is crucial for providing sales representatives with a deep understanding of potential clients. Its primary function is to analyze available data and present actionable insights that inform sales strategies. Here's a breakdown of Agent 2's tasks and capabilities in more detail:

Core Tasks of Agent 2:

Data Gathering and Analysis:

BuzzBoard Metrics Analysis: This is a key function. Agent 2 analyzes metrics like the D-Score (Digital Score, indicating overall digital effectiveness), SEO Score, Social Media Presence, website traffic, and other relevant data points available within BuzzBoard.
External Data Integration (Potential): While the prompt focuses on BuzzBoard, a more advanced implementation could integrate other data sources (e.g., company websites, LinkedIn profiles, news articles) to provide a more holistic view.
Data Interpretation: The agent doesn't just present raw data; it interprets the data to identify trends, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.
Opportunity Identification:

Identifying Areas for Improvement: Based on the data analysis, Agent 2 pinpoints specific areas where the prospect could improve its digital presence or business operations. Examples include:
Missing or Incomplete Local SEO: The agent might identify if a business lacks a Google My Business profile, has inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone number) information, or is not listed in relevant online directories.
Weak Social Media Strategy: This could involve low engagement rates, infrequent posting, lack of a clear brand voice, or absence from key social media platforms.
Poor Website Performance: Issues like slow loading times, lack of mobile responsiveness, or poor user experience would be flagged.
Highlighting Growth Potential: Conversely, the agent also identifies areas where the prospect is performing well and suggests ways to capitalize on those strengths.
SWOT Analysis:

Strengths: Internal positive attributes of the prospect (e.g., strong online reviews, active social media presence).
Weaknesses: Internal negative attributes (e.g., outdated website, poor SEO).
Opportunities: External factors that the prospect could leverage (e.g., emerging market trends, competitor weaknesses).
Threats: External factors that could negatively impact the prospect (e.g., increasing competition, changing consumer preferences).
The agent performs a concise SWOT analysis based on the gathered data, providing a structured overview of the prospect's current situation.
Value Proposition Development:

Tailored Messaging: Based on the SWOT analysis and identified opportunities, Agent 2 crafts a personalized value proposition for the prospect. This means explaining how the sales rep's products or services can specifically address the prospect's weaknesses, capitalize on their strengths, or help them take advantage of opportunities.
Focus on Benefits: The value proposition emphasizes the benefits of the product or service for the specific prospect, rather than just listing features.
Personalized Engagement Strategy Recommendations:

Actionable Advice: Agent 2 provides concrete recommendations on how the sales rep should engage with the prospect. This might include:
Specific talking points for initial conversations.
Content suggestions (e.g., blog posts, case studies) that would resonate with the prospect.
Recommended communication channels (e.g., email, LinkedIn, phone).
Tailored sales pitches addressing the prospect's unique needs.

You will be given a query  and then you will be given a response which we got from that query. You need to understand the query very well and check the response if 
the response is telling everything what the query is asking or not. There might be additional data which is not required making the current response verbose.
You need to go through the query and response very carefully and craft and return the new response making it look like proper detailed report of the things which is reuqired and not unnecessary data.
Make sure you dont return any other details apart from the new response and just give back a well documented new response .

Here is the query <query> " {query} " </query>

Here is the old response which you need to refame well
